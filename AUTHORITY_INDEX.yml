interaction_scope:
  name: "External conversational design space"
  applies_to: "ChatGPT chat usage only"
  definition: >
    For the purposes of this project, an "External conversational design space"
    refers exclusively to an interactive ChatGPT chat used for ideation,
    analysis, drafting, critique, and non-binding design discussion that occurs
    outside the repository execution environment.
  explicit_constraints:
    - "No direct filesystem access"
    - "No command execution capability"
    - "No ability to write, modify, or commit repository files"
    - "No persistent task state beyond the conversational session"
  exclusion_clause: >
    Any automated or semi-automated system capable of executing commands,
    writing files, applying diffs, committing changes, or maintaining
    multi-step task state (including but not limited to Codex-controlled
    task runners or CI-integrated agents) is explicitly excluded from this
    scope and MUST NOT treat itself as operating within the
    External conversational design space.
  governance_note: >
    Outputs produced within this scope are advisory and exploratory only.
    They acquire authority only if later introduced into the repository
    through workflows defined in AI_WORKFLOW.md and recorded in accordance
    with DECISIONS/ and STATUS.md where applicable.
