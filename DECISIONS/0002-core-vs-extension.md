# ADR 0002: Core vs. extension model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project benefits from alignment with SNAP:DRGN concepts while also needing Psellos-specific narrative layers and interpretive constructs.

## Decision
Align the core model to SNAP:DRGN concepts and place Psellos-specific needs in a clearly demarcated extension namespace.

## Consequences
- Export and mapping to SNAP-aligned tooling remain feasible.
- Narrative layering and jurisdictional semantics live in the extension.
