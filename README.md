# Psellos Hub

Psellos is a SNAP-aligned prosopography initiative with an explicit extension for narrative layers, allowing structured persons/roles/relations to coexist with interpretive and temporal storytelling. This hub keeps coordination, governance, and shared planning lightweight across the Psellos ecosystem.

The project spans multiple repos:
- psellos-spec: core data model, schemas, and controlled vocabularies.
- psellos-data: curated datasets and fixtures used to validate and exercise the model.
- psellos-builder: transforms spec + data into compiled artifacts.
- psellos-web: consumes artifacts to provide a user-facing experience.

## Getting started
Recommended order: psellos-spec → psellos-data → psellos-builder → psellos-web.

## Non-affiliation
Psellos is an independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any institution, organization, or initiative.
